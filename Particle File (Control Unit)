//Features: Alarm, Power Conservation, GPS, Door Security 

// Variables
int led = D1;
int ppl = 2; //Keeps track of how many people are in the room ()
int sleepmode = 0; //Triggers when sleepmode is activated. If motion is sensed, turns on lights to dim setting, similar to a night light
//int secflag = 0; //Security System flag- similar to ppl variable, security system activates when both members have left GPS area

// setup() is run only once, it's where we set up GPIO and initialise peripherals
void setup() {
  // Setup GPIO
  pinMode(led,OUTPUT); // Our LED pin is output (lighting up the LED)
  //pinMode(boardLed,OUTPUT); // Our on-board LED is output as well

  // Subscribe to an event published by IFTTT using Particle.subscribe
  //Event Trigger
  Particle.subscribe("dorm1234", Dorm);

// loop() runs continuously, it's our infinite loop. In this program we only want to respond to events, so loop can be empty.

// Now for the myHandler function, which is called when the Particle cloud tells us that our email event is published.
