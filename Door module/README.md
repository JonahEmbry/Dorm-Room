The Door Module is a sensor hub of this system. It uses a Particle Photon to process these sensors, then sends the information to other devices using the Particle Cloud. The Door Module lives on the door and gives the systems information about the activities of the inhabitants of the dormroom. 

The Door Module Particle Code should be opened within the Github editor, copied and pasted into the Particle IDE, then flashed onto the Particle Photon.

Current features: Security System, Push button
