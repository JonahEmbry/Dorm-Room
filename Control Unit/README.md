The Control Unit is the central core of this system. It is responsible for the alarms, digital calendar, power save mode, and other important feautures of the system. It communicates to other devices using Particle, which is downloaded onto the Raspberry Pi, then flashed onto the system using the Particle IDE. 

The Alarm, GPS, Security, and Shutdown files should be downloaded in their folders and uploaded directly into the home directory of the Raspberry Pi. The Control Unit Particle Code should be opened within the Github editor, copied and pasted into the Particle IDE, then flashed onto the Raspberry Pi.

Current features: Remote Alarm, Intruder Alarm, GPS, Power Save Mode, Digital Calendar
